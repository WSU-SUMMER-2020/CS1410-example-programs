C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic
programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and
large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[6]
C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths
being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[6] including desktop
applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical
applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[7] C++ is a compiled language, with
implementations of it available on many platforms. Many vendors provide C++ compilers, including
the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM.

C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest
standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017
(informally known as C++17).[8] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as
ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11 and C++14 standards. The current
C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the
initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979,
as an extension of the C language as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C,
which also provided high-level features for program organization. C++20 is the next planned
standard thereafter.

Many other programming languages have been influenced by C++, including C#, D, Java, and newer
versions of C.

In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with Classes", the
predecessor to C++.[9] The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's
experience in programming for his Ph.D. thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were
very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use,
while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When
Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel
with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his Ph.D. experience, Stroustrup set out to
enhance the C language with Simula-like features.[10] C was chosen because it was general-purpose,
fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also
influenced C++, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.

Initially, Stroustrup's "C with Classes" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including classes,
derived classes, strong typing, inlining and default arguments.[11]

In 1983, "C with Classes" was renamed to "C++" (++ being the increment operator in C), adding new
features that included virtual functions, function name and operator overloading, references,
constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and
BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes (//). Furthermore, it included the
development of a standalone compiler for C++, Cfront.

In 1985, the first edition of The C++ Programming Language was released, which became the definitive
reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard.[12] The first commercial
implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year.[9]

In 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C++ Programming Language
in 1991.[13] New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member
functions, const member functions, and protected members. In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference
Manual was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions
included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a boolean type.

After the 2.0 update, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the C++11 standard was released,
adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities
to C++ programmers. After a minor C++14 update released in December 2014, various new additions
were introduced in C++17, and further changes planned for 2020.[14]

As of 2017, C++ remains the third most popular programming language, behind Java and C.[15][16]

On January 3, 2018, Stroustrup was announced as the 2018 winner of the Charles Stark Draper Prize
for Engineering, which comes with $500,000, "for conceptualizing and developing the C++ programming
language."[17]
